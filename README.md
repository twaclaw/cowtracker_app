# Happy Cows

## A LoRaWAN&reg;-based cow-tracker application (backend)

Our cows enjoy gorgeous views and roam around freely at 3300 m.a.s.l in the Colombian Andes. The freedom and meditative scenery provided by the evergreen mountains comes at a price. The location is remote and accessibility is reduced.

We care a great deal about our cows and want to make sure that they are always safe and sound, this is why we decided to implement a tracking solution. On the one hand, we want to be able to find them when they venture into the forest. On the other hand, we want to be able to establish when a cow is not moving and requires assistance.
